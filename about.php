			<h1>About me..</h1>
			<p>My name is Sarah and I am a BCIT Technical Web Design graduate looking for a Junior Front-End Web Developer position. But what else? I love food, 90's hip hop, 80's sci-fi, and almost anything on HBO. My boyfriend and I have two cats named Zelda and Zach Morris.</p>

			<p>I also love to travel. It was the one thing I knew for certain I needed to do with my life - to visit as many countries as possible and experience as many new things as possible. So far I've traveled to 36 countries across 5 continents. Some of my favourites include Myanmar, Laos, Turkey, Botswana and Guatemala... though honestly I have loved every single country.</p>

			<p>As much as I love to travel, however, I also love Vancouver. Living near the mountains and the ocean is something I hope never to take for granted (I wanted that to come through in my personal logo, which I talk more about on <a href="project_portfolio.php">my project page</a>).</p>
